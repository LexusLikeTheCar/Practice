TODO:
*add the js on all the pages
*I am currently learning wordpress so that's why the page link does not work yet. I am learning how to code on it and I'm gonna create a blog 
*I am gonna try to learn how to create a header file for the repetitive HTML (yes i know its ugly and not that professional) BUT i don't know php that well yet and so far that's all i have found in to link a .h file 
*i will probably add bootstrap in the feature and sweetalerts because I love those frameworks and they are cute but for now I am just refreshing my CSS so im doing it the long way
*this is strictly HTML and CSS practice so the JS is going to be very lower level
